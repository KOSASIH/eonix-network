Eonix Machine Learning Framework
==============================

Overview
--------

The Eonix Machine Learning Framework is a decentralized, open-source framework for building, training, and deploying machine learning models on the Eonix Network. The framework is designed to provide a secure, scalable, and efficient way to build and deploy machine learning models.

Components
------------

### Model Training

Model training is the process of training a machine learning model on a dataset. The Eonix Machine Learning Framework provides a decentralized approach to model training, allowing multiple nodes to contribute to the training process.

### Model Deployment

Model deployment is the process of deploying a trained machine learning model on the Eonix Network. The framework provides a secure and scalable way to deploy models, allowing them to be used by decentralized applications (dApps) and other nodes on the network.

### Data Management

Data management is the process of managing and storing data used for model training and deployment. The Eonix Machine Learning Framework provides a decentralized approach to data management, allowing data to be stored and managed in a secure and scalable way.

### Incentivization

Incentivization is the process of incentivizing nodes to contribute to the model training and deployment process. The Eonix Machine Learning Framework provides a token-based incentivization system, allowing nodes to be rewarded for their contributions.
