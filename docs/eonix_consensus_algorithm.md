Eonix Consensus Algorithm
==========================

Overview
--------

The Eonix Consensus Algorithm is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) algorithm that ensures the integrity and consistency of the Eonix blockchain. The algorithm is designed to be energy-efficient, scalable, and secure.

Components
------------

### Leader Node

The leader node is responsible for proposing new blocks to be added to the blockchain. The leader node is chosen through a random selection process.

### Validator Nodes

Validator nodes are responsible for validating the transactions and smart contract interactions within a block. They also participate in the consensus algorithm to ensure the integrity of the blockchain.

### Block Proposal

The block proposal is a set of transactions and smart contract interactions that are proposed to be added to the blockchain.

### Voting

Validator nodes vote on the proposed block to ensure that it is valid and consistent with the current state of the blockchain.

### Block Confirmation

Once a proposed block has been validated and voted on, it is added to the blockchain and confirmed by the network.
