Eonix IoT Integrations
=====================

Overview
--------

The Eonix IoT integrations enable the connection of Internet of Things (IoT) devices to the Eonix Network, allowing for secure, scalable, and efficient data exchange between devices and the blockchain.

Components
------------

### IoT Devices

IoT devices are physical devices that are connected to the internet and can collect and transmit data. Examples of IoT devices include sensors, actuators, and smart home devices.

### IoT Gateways

IoT gateways are devices that connect IoT devices to the Eonix Network, allowing for secure and efficient data exchange.

### Data Processing

Data processing is the process of processing and analyzing data from IoT devices. The Eonix IoT integrations provide a decentralized approach to data processing, allowing for secure and efficient processing of large amounts of data.

### Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written directly into lines of code. They are used to automate the interaction between IoT devices and the Eonix Network.
